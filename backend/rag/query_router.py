"""
Query Router

Detects query intent and routes to the appropriate retrieval strategy:
- factual_lookup: Standard hybrid retrieval → reranker → generator
- aggregation: MongoDB structured query first, supplement with RAG
- comparison: Parallel retrievals for multiple companies, merge context

This is a smart routing layer — not all queries need full RAG.
Some are better served by the structured store directly.
