"""
Top Asked — web-grounded DSA + core-subject interview questions for a company.

"Top Asked" tab of Fast Prep. Uses Gemini with Google Search grounding (the same
approach as company_report.py) so every question is backed by a REAL web source:
GeeksforGeeks, LeetCode Discuss, Glassdoor, AmbitionBox, InterviewBit, blogs,
company experience pages. Source titles + URLs come straight from
grounding_metadata.

SDE/software-role oriented by design: only technical questions. DSA questions and
core-subject conceptual questions (OOPS/DBMS/SQL/OS/CN/System Design) are
separated into two lists. HR / behavioural / "tell me about yourself" questions
are excluded.

Why web grounding and not the ChromaDB corpus? The ingested corpus is tiny and
sparse — most companies have no interview-experience PDFs. For "what all does
this company actually ask", live web retrieval is the only source with real
coverage.

Model note: grounding needs a FULL model (lite = instant 429 on free tier);
thinking_budget=512 keeps it at ~10-24s while still producing grounding sources.

PROMPT = """\
You are a placement-prep research analyst for an INDIAN engineering student preparing for an SDE (software development engineer) role at "{company}". Use the web search tool (never rely on memory) to research what questions this company ACTUALLY asks in its technical interviews, then produce a structured list.

Focus: what the company asks in SOFTWARE / SDE / ENGINEERING interviews (campus + experienced). Search sites like GeeksforGeeks, LeetCode Discuss, Glassdoor, AmbitionBox, InterviewBit, CareerCup, and personal experience blogs.

Return ONLY raw JSON (no markdown fences, no explanation) in exactly this shape:
{{
  "role": "the SDE/software role these questions apply to, from the sources (e.g. 'Software Development Engineer', 'Software Engineer')",
  "dsa_questions": [

GROUNDING RULES
- Every question MUST be one this company actually asks, per the sources you found. Do NOT invent questions. Do NOT pad with generic questions the company isn't known for.
- dsa_questions: coding/algorithm questions. Include the difficulty and a topic tag.
- core_questions: conceptual questions about OOPS, DBMS, SQL, Operating Systems, Computer Networks, or System Design. Use EXACTLY one of those six subject labels in "subject".
- STRICTLY EXCLUDE: HR, behavioural, situational, managerial, and resume-based questions ("Tell me about yourself", "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?", salary expectations, etc.). TECHNICAL / SDE questions ONLY.
- Aim for 8-15 questions in EACH of dsa_questions and core_questions.
- Sources MUST be the actual URLs returned by the search tool — do not invent or reconstruct URLs.
- Every question must be supported by a source in "sources".
- If you cannot find reliable technical-interview information for this company, return:
  {{"error": "No reliable technical-interview information found for this company."}}
